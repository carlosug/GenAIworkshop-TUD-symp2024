# GenAIworksop-TUD-symp2024
 Workshop on "Exploration of AI tools for research software" at [Spring Symposium - AI Education](https://www.tudelft.nl/evenementen/2024/delft-ai/spring-symposium-ai-education) hosted by [TU Delft | Initiative](https://www.tudelft.nl/evenementen/2024/delft-ai/spring-symposium-ai-education)
 
- **When**: 04 June 2024
- **Where**: Delft University of Technology, at MondAI
- **Who, the instructors**: Carlos, Halford, Fardad
- **Who, the helpers**:


## 1. Workshop description

This workshop will explore the usage of generative AI in research, including code assistance, integration into research software development, and the exchange of experiences and best practices. The agenda covers essential topics: introducing LLMs, examining the impact of code assistants on research software development, and exploring responsible use and legal implications of generative AI tools like GitHub Copilot, concluding with a practical session using GitHub Copilot for software documentation.

**Prerequisites**: GitHub account, basic familiarity with git, Github, and version control, programming in a scripting language such as Python/R

**Audience**: scientific/researcher programmers interested in automating components of their code/research workflows through existing tools for software continuous integration/deployment and documentation.

**Key Learning Objectives**:
- Learners distinguish between traditional versus Generative AI tools **i.e., Github Copilot**, and understand their role within the research software development cycle;
- Learners are capable of using Github Copilot in several different ways and can determine what feature could be useful in typical research software management applications;
- Learners can detect Copilot capabilities, and its application in VS Code for research purposes to know how to make the most out of the tool.
